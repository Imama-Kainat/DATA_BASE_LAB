 Here is a comprehensive overview of subqueries, including various types, their usage, syntax, and examples.

### Types of Subqueries

1. **Single-row subquery**
2. **Multiple-row subquery**
3. **Multiple-column subquery**
4. **Correlated subquery**
5. **Subqueries in SELECT clause**
6. **Subqueries in FROM clause**
7. **Subqueries in WHERE clause**
8. **Subqueries in HAVING clause**

### 1. Single-row Subquery

A single-row subquery returns only one row.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM main_table
WHERE column = (SELECT sub_column FROM sub_table WHERE condition);
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```

### 2. Multiple-row Subquery

A multiple-row subquery returns more than one row. Typically used with `IN`, `ANY`, or `ALL` operators.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM main_table
WHERE column IN (SELECT sub_column FROM sub_table WHERE condition);
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location_id = 1700);
```

### 3. Multiple-column Subquery

A multiple-column subquery returns more than one column.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM main_table
WHERE (column1, column2) IN (SELECT sub_column1, sub_column2 FROM sub_table WHERE condition);
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name
FROM employees
WHERE (department_id, job_id) IN (SELECT department_id, job_id FROM job_history WHERE end_date IS NULL);
```

### 4. Correlated Subquery

A correlated subquery refers to a column from the outer query. It is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM main_table AS alias
WHERE column = (SELECT sub_column FROM sub_table WHERE condition AND alias.column = sub_table.column);
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name
FROM employees e
WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);
```

### 5. Subqueries in the SELECT Clause

Subqueries can be used in the `SELECT` clause to return a value that will be displayed as a column.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, (SELECT sub_column FROM sub_table WHERE condition) AS alias
FROM main_table;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, (SELECT department_name FROM departments WHERE departments.department_id = employees.department_id) AS department_name
FROM employees;
```

### 6. Subqueries in the FROM Clause

Subqueries in the `FROM` clause are used to define a derived table that can be used in the outer query.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT main_table.column1, subquery_table.sub_column
FROM main_table
JOIN (SELECT sub_column FROM sub_table WHERE condition) AS subquery_table
ON main_table.column = subquery_table.column;
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, dept_count.total
FROM employees e
JOIN (SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total FROM employees GROUP BY department_id) dept_count
ON e.department_id = dept_count.department_id;
```

### 7. Subqueries in the WHERE Clause

Subqueries in the `WHERE` clause filter the rows of the outer query based on the result of the subquery.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM main_table
WHERE column = (SELECT sub_column FROM sub_table WHERE condition);
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```

### 8. Subqueries in the HAVING Clause

Subqueries in the `HAVING` clause filter groups of rows defined by the `GROUP BY` clause.

#### Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM main_table
GROUP BY column1
HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT AVG(sub_column) FROM sub_table WHERE condition);
```

#### Example:
```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT AVG(count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM employees GROUP BY department_id) subquery);
```

### Detailed Explanation of Subqueries

1. **Single-row Subquery**: Returns a single row and a single column. If the subquery returns more than one row, an error occurs.
    ```sql
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
    ```

2. **Multiple-row Subquery**: Returns multiple rows and a single column. Used with `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`.
    ```sql
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location_id = 1700);
    ```

3. **Multiple-column Subquery**: Returns multiple rows and multiple columns.
    ```sql
    SELECT employee_id, first_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE (department_id, job_id) IN (SELECT department_id, job_id FROM job_history WHERE end_date IS NULL);
    ```

4. **Correlated Subquery**: Refers to columns in the outer query. It runs once for each row of the outer query.
    ```sql
    SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name
    FROM employees e
    WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id);
    ```

5. **Subquery in the SELECT Clause**: Subqueries used to return values in the `SELECT` clause.
    ```sql
    SELECT first_name, last_name, (SELECT department_name FROM departments WHERE departments.department_id = employees.department_id) AS department_name
    FROM employees;
    ```

6. **Subquery in the FROM Clause**: Subqueries used to create derived tables in the `FROM` clause.
    ```sql
    SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, dept_count.total
    FROM employees e
    JOIN (SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS total FROM employees GROUP BY department_id) dept_count
    ON e.department_id = dept_count.department_id;
    ```

7. **Subquery in the WHERE Clause**: Subqueries used to filter rows in the `WHERE` clause.
    ```sql
    SELECT first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
    ```

8. **Subquery in the HAVING Clause**: Subqueries used to filter groups in the `HAVING` clause.
    ```sql
    SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT AVG(count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM employees GROUP BY department_id) subquery);
    ```

Subqueries are a powerful feature in SQL, enabling complex queries and data retrieval that would be difficult to achieve with simple joins or filtering alone. They allow for greater flexibility and can be nested to multiple levels, although for readability and performance, it's often advisable to keep the nesting to a manageable level.
